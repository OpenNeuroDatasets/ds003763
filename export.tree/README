The dataset contains fMRI data from a heartbeat detection task in 30 participants aged 40–65 years, with no history of cardiovascular events, such as stroke or myocardial infarction, and no severe white matter hyperintensities according to structural MRI (modified Fazekas score of 2 or less).

Heartbeat detection task is described in the following publications:

The Matlab script used for stimuli presentation is contained in the "presentation_script.tar.gz" achive.

The file participants.tsv contains data on age, sex, self-reported medical conditions ("hypertension" — primary arterial hypertension, "gastrointestinal"  — gastrointestinal diseases,	"thyroiditis" — autoimmune thyroiditis, "diabetes" — type 2 diabetes mellitus), Beck Depression Inventory ("BDI"), Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ("SSTAI_S" — state anxiety, "SSTAI_T" — trait anxiety), interoceptive accuracy ("IAcc").

27 participants also underwent rubber hand illusion. The data is contained in participants.tsv: "drift_emerg_15" corresponds to the proprioceptive drift after 15 s from the onset of emergence phase, "test_own_15" and "control_own_15" correspond to the sum of test and control questions from the ownership questionary after 15 s from the onset of emergence phase. The rubber hand illusion experiment is described in the following publication:
